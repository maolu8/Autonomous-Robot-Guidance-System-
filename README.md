# Autonomous-Robot-Guidance-System-
This project implements an autonomous robot guidance system using a microcontroller-based finite state machine (FSM) to navigate an unknown path environment. The robot performs line following, junction detection, turning, and obstacle recovery through real-time sensor feedback and control logic.
